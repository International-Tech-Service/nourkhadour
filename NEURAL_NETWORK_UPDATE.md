## 🎨 Neural Network Features

### Visual Design
```
Layer Structure: Input (5) → Hidden (8) → Hidden (8) → Output (5)
Node Colors: Gray (inactive) → Purple gradient (active)
Connection Colors: Dark gray (inactive) → Purple (active)
Signal Particles: Purple dots traveling along connections
Glow Effects: Radial gradient with purple halo
```

### Interactive Behavior

**Mouse Hover:**
- Activates nodes within 100px radius
- Triggers connected nodes in adjacent layers
- Creates cascade effect through the network
- Purple glow appears on activated nodes

**Auto-Activation:**
- Continuous waves propagate through layers
- Layer-by-layer activation pattern
- 1.5 second activation duration
- Smooth transitions between states

**Visual Feedback:**
- Signal particles travel along active connections
- Node size increases when activated (5px → 8px)
- Connection thickness increases (1px → 2px)
- Glow effects with blur and transparency

### Performance Optimizations

✅ **View-based rendering**: Only animates when section is visible (200px margin)
✅ **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60 FPS animation
✅ **Lightweight**: No external dependencies, pure canvas rendering
✅ **Auto-pause**: Stops when scrolled past
✅ **Efficient calculations**: Optimized distance checks and particle updates
